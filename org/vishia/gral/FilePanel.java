/**This class is a widget to select and view files.
 * It can be used in any application in a window, which is opened on demand 
 * or which is open any time. The last case is similar like a panel of the old Norton Commander
 * or its modern adequate applications.
 * 
 * The files are shown in a table. The appearance of the table can be controlled by the application
 * or maybe by the user. Files are able to select.
 * 
 * The content of any file is able to view in a simple format, it is text or simple binary.
 * A text file is able to edit from this point of focus. That are the key functionality <F3> and <F4>
 * of the Norton Commander.
 * 
 * The files are able to delete, rename or move, if this functionality is enabled by the application program.
