/**The Area9 is a window, which contains 9 areas for graphical content.
 * The basic idea is, that simple and easy applications should not be a complex window handling,
 * which is not proper to use. A easy application should represent its content in static areas,
 * which are known by the user. Typical there is a main area, for example for some dialog fields.
 * Additional there is an output area and a tree-select area. That's all.
 * In this example the user can build the three areas using the 9 given possible areas
 * at top-left, left and bottom.
 * <br><br>
 * The borders of the area are either fix or move-able using the mouse or some config files.
 * The implementation is graphic-system-specific, but the interface to that panel system is given
 * in this package. 
 * <br><br>
 * This package contains some basic or example applications too.
